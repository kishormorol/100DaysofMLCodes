# Data-Visualization-with-Python
### Coursera-Project

These course materials belong entirely to Coursera. The answers are the only things that show my trials.


Key Concepts:
===============
1) Use Pandas to produce a table to visualize the data.
2) Produce a data plot using MatPlotLib Pyplot.
3) Use Seaborn to create a scatterplot graph.
4) Create a Jointplot to show distribution.
5) Create a heatmap to show correlations and distributions.


Great thanks to the course instructor: Dave Dalsveen
